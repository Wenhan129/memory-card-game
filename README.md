# Memory Game Project

This project is a memory card game. Your goal is to match all the cards on the deck with your memory skills.

## Instructions

To start the game, just click a folded card in the deck. It will flip to show the pattern, and then choose another card. If these two cards have the same pattern, it's a match! Otherwise, the cards will flip back. You'd better memorize the patterns of these cards, next time you flip a card which has the pattern already appeared and you can match it.
This game also has a rating system, if you can finish the game in 15 moves, you got 3 stars. 15-20 moves, 2 stars. 20 moves more, 1 star.
